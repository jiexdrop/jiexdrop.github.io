In this game you are able to freeze water so you can walk over it. The water level can be changed if the water is not freezed. I made a very simple level in order illustrate this idea.

Made for the Godot engine Jam in June 2018. Used fps tutorial here and water shaders here. The levels and the meshes were modeled in Blender.

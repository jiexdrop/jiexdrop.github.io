A game where two aliens try to complete tasks while making a Big Mess.

I worked in the task systems and interface interactions.
* Debug a complex system
* Created a generic system that can enable the player to use any tool
* Utilization of Unity Events that was later removed from the project

Enjmin 2nd year project by 9 students.

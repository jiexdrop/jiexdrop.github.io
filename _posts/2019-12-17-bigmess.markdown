# Description

A game where two aliens try to complete tasks while making a Big Mess.

I worked in the task systems and interface interactions.


# What I learnt and created
* Prototyping simple things fast, deal with fixes later
* Generic system that enables the player to use any tool
* Animations and particles

Enjmin 2nd year project by 9 students.

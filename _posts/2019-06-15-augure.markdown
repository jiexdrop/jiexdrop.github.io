One of your closest relatives disappeared.  In order to find them, you enter in a strange curiosity cabinet. Youâ€™ll be then invited to draw 3 tarot cards and solve their puzzles to find information about the disappearance of this cherished person.

I was a Unity programmer for this project. We made this project at the Enjmin 2019.

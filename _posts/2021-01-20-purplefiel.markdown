# Description

A simple cross-platform 4 players multiplayer RPG.
Focus on interactions with a lot of enemies, controlled by simple AI.

# A game dev challenge

I was making a video devlog each day. It was mainly for myself, to get motivated, and to keep a routine.

I was at day 30 before I found a job. *(Yes, I have more videos like this one)*

# What I learnt and created
* Used Mirror (high level multiplayer API) for Unity.
* Synchronized entities between multiple instances of the game.
* Worked in improving smoothness of movement of the player character.
* Implemented and debugged multiplayer gameplay

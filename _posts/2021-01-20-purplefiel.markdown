# Description

100 Days of Game Dev Challenge


I was at day 30 before I found a job.

I was making a video devlog each day. It was mainly for myself, to get motivated, and to keep a routine.


*(Yes, I have more videos like this one)*


# What I learnt and created
* Used Mirror (hight level multiplayer API) for Unity.
* Synchronized entities between multiple instances of the game.
* Worked in improving smoothness of movement of the player character.
* Implemented and debuged multiplayer gameplay

# Description

A simple cross-platform 4 players multiplayer RPG.
Focus on interactions with a lot of enemies, controlled by simple AI.

# What I learnt and created
* Used Mirror (high level multiplayer API) for Unity.
* Synchronized entities between multiple instances of the game.
* Worked in improving smoothness of movement of the player character.
* Implemented and debugged multiplayer gameplay (inventory system, bullets colisions...)

# Description

In this game, you are able to freeze water, so you can walk over it. The water level can be changed if the water is not frozen.


Made for the Godot engine Jam in June 2018.


The levels and the meshes were modeled in Blender.


* Worked with GdScript
* Learned animations timelines and events in Godot
* Adaptability to new programming languages

# Description

A 2d dungeon crawler in multiplayer.

# What I learnt and created
* The multiplayer portion was made with UDP/TCP C# classes.
* Learned how to smoothly interpolate players.
* The players can connect form any device Unity targets.
* Simple levels automatically generated.
* Monster waves in rooms probably use a state machine.

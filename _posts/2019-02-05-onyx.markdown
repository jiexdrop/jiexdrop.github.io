# Description

Onyx Thief is a twin-stick shooter where you can't shoot any bullet. Instead you have to use your shield and your hook to ram into enemies.

I was a Unity programmer for this project.


We made this project at the Enjmin in 2019.

# What I learnt:
* Movement of the player ship, and hook
* Use of state machines
* Integrated assets

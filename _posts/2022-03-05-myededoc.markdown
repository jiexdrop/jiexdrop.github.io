# MyEDEDOC

MyEdedoc centralised various apps in itself.

I was in charge of Payslips (MyBSE) and vacations planning [MyCONGES]({% post_url 2022-03-05-myconges %}) inside the app. 

This app also opens [MyNDF]({% post_url 2021-07-29-myndf %}). 


# MyBSE

An app to view, download or share payslips. (the app in the video)

The app is mostly destined to professionals. It needs an Ededoc account.

# What I learnt 
* How to connect to a middleware
* App design
* Publish an app to the Apple and Google stores

# Flutter 

Flutter is a structured way of creating apps.

It has rules that improve the robustness of the apps we create:
* Only update state on the parts of the app we change.
* Use of controllers.

For me it was the perfect place to "stand on the shoulders of giants" and take my software architecture knowledge to the next level.
And I'm still learning with it!
